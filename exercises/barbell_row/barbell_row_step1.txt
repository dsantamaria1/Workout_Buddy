1. Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart, or just slightly wider, with your toes pointed forward. The correctly weighted barbell should be on the ground in front of you. Bend your knees to squat down and grab the barbell, placing your hands palms down, just wider than your knees. Keep your back flat and chest up. Face forward while keeping your spine in a neutral position. Without lifting your heels from the floor, exhale as you straighten your knees so you're in a standing position, with the barbell in your hands. Keep a slight bend in your knees and lean your torso forward slightly so the barbell is midway up your thigh with your arms straightened. This is the starting position.
