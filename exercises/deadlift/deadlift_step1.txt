1. Place the barbell on the floor in front of your feet. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Pull your abdominal muscles in toward your spine, engage your glutes, lift your chest and slide the shoulder blades down your back. Bend your knees and hinge your hips back to lower toward the floor. Take hold of the barbell with an overhand grip, hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width. This is the starting position.
